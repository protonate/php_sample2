          <p><strong>THE SOCCER MOM CONTEMPLATING HER MARRIAGE<br /> 
            </strong><strong>37, female, Lake Oswego, Oregon, straight, married for 9 years</strong></p> 
          <p><strong>DAY ONE </strong><br /> 
            <strong>8:37a.m.: </strong>Just dropped the kids off at school, and now sitting down for my first entry. I decided to write this because I'm lonely. You wouldn't know it if you saw me on the street--two kids (8, 11), Toyota, still-attractive husband'but it's true.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            <strong>9:19a.m.:</strong> Just saw some singer I don't recognize on The View say "I love my life!" Strikes me that I don't love my life. I like it many times, but don't love. I've been with my husband since I was 26, and he's wonderful, but I don't think he's my soulmate. I would know, right?<br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>10:00a.m.: </strong>On the phone with Anne, my best friend. We're phone friends--talk constantly, rarely see each other. She's pissed at her unemployed husband, who's apparently not looking very hard for work. I tread carefully. The one thing we never talk about is our marriages: she married him at 31 because no one else asked. Shhhh. Secret.<br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>11:15a.m.:</strong> Leave a message for Colin at work. He's a manager in a huge company that's constantly downsizing. He practices his layoff speeches on me. The atmosphere has put a damper in our midday communication'I just don't feel moved to hear that some secretary is sobbing about not wanting to part with a paperweight that no longer belongs to her. <br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>12:15p.m.: </strong>Off to my part-time job. I have to be honest and say I have no idea how moms work fulltime. I worked fulltime (RN) until Taylor was born, but now I barely have time to show up 20 hours a week. <br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>5:30p.m.: </strong>Taylor, the 11-year-old, asks in the car why some condoms are colored. I stall with questions. It turns out he walked past Condom Kingdom with his friends and saw pink ones. I told him that whenever something is mandatory, people like to dress it up to make it more fun. That was good parenting, right? Honest, yet pro safe sex? <br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>6:35p.m.: </strong>Colin comes home from work looking drained, and immediately swaps his khakis for flannel bottoms. He says hi as he walks past me, and asks what the dinner plan is and whether I need help. At no point in over an hour does he touch me or ask how my day is.<br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>7:00p.m.: </strong>Sam (the 8 year-old), Colin, and I eat dinner; Taylor's at a scouts thing.  Sam leads the conversation, with Colin right behind. He's in a train phase, which Colin encourages, and is regaling us with how he took apart a locomotive.<br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>9:15p.m.: </strong>Colin and I are both in the bedroom, with Taylor running in and out with homework questions. It's not that our marriage isn't pleasant. That's the problem. It's completely, 100% pleasant. And nothing more. <br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>9:30p.m.: </strong>My college roommate Bev calls to say hello. She's divorced and remarrying, and I'm unofficially in charge of the bridal party. Colin picks up first, and they chat for a moment. He hands over the phone, and she comments, "You did so well with that one."<br /> 
            </p> 
          <p><strong>10:45p.m.: </strong>Colin's out cold before I get in bed.</p>
